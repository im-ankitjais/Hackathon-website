            <h2>What Is Project AntiVenom?</h2>
            <p>Project AntiVenom is an innovative idea of bringing  technology in to the aid of human problems.<br/> Currently, region specific for the Indian state of Odisha, this project aims at improving the disastrous situation between humans and snakes.</p>

                <p>

                </p>
                 <p>
                     A year back, we had this idea, Project AntiVenom, but we were doubtful about its feasibility. Ultimately, we left it on the sheets.<br/><br/>
                     But, we came back on this idea some months ago and today, it stands in front of us, alive!<br/><br/>
                     Our application is focused on the context of snakebites being a State-Specific disaster for Odisha. Undoubtedly, this is a matter of great concern, but what’s surprising is that, till now, no impactful steps have been taken to cope up with it. Hence we created an minimalistic app from scratch, which can :
    
                  </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify a snake and tell if its venomous or not, along with its breed.</li>
                  <li>Provide an option to call the snake rescuers after the identification.</li>
                  <li>Provide an option to call the ambulance helpline in case of emergency.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>
                  We have other features which are yet to be implemented because of some development hiccups. Still, even now, the app will serve as an all-in-one solution for human-snake encounters. We hope that this project will be the genesis of bigger endeavours and even bigger innovations.

                <h2>Why we created this Project.</h2>
                  <h3>The number of snakebite related deaths was peeking and a solution was needed.
                       So, Project AntiVenom came along which can perform various things for snake encounters and emergencies. 
                       We kept the group very small, so as to avoid any copy or imitation. This is our first “Innovate To Solve” project, 
                       solely for public use and welfare.
